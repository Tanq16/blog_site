# FunBoxEasy

## Enumeration

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.101.111`

### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -A -Pn -p- -T4 -o nmap.txt 192.168.101.111`

OS Detection &rarr;  `OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`

| **Port** | **Service** | **Other details (if any)**                                   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 22       | SSH         | OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) |
| 80       | HTTP        | Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))                               |

### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.101.111 -f -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- robots.txt
- index.html
- index.php
- profile.php (302)
- header.php
- registration.php
- logout.php
- dashboard.php (302)
- leftbar.php
- forgot-password.php
- hitcounter.txt
- icons/ (403)
- store/
- admin/
- secret/
- gym/

Robots txt file contains the disallwed entry for `gym`, which was already found by gobuster.

## Exploitation

Looking at the `store` directory, there is a book store with an admin login on the bottom of the page. This has the ability to add a new book which also has a file upload capability. This file is rendered as an image when visiting the book list via the publisher list. The publisher chosen for this was the Packt Publishing because it had 0 books.

The image being rendered can be navigated to separately at the location `/store/bootstrap/img/test.php`. The contents of the php file were first `<?php echo "Hello Test"; ?>` to test if the code is actually executed. This did execute upon visiting the aforementioned location, therefore, the code was replaced with the pentest monkey reverse shell.

This gives a reverse shell on the system when listening with netcat. This also gave the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation

### User

Looking at the `/etc/passwd` file, there are 2 users of interest &rarr; `tony` and `root`. Looking at the home directory of `tony`, it is readable by `www-data`. This directory had a `password.txt` file with the following contents &rarr;

```
ssh: yxcvbnmYYY
gym/admin: asdfghjklXXX
/store: admin@admin.com admin
```

The ssh password allows access to the machine as user `tony`.

### Root

Looked at the sudo capabilities of the user `tony`. The interesting entries were `whois`, `finger`, `time` and `cancel`. Out of these, only `time` was the tool which was already installed. `time` is a command that runs the command passed to it and records the time it took for the command to execute. Since sudo operation is allowed on it, it may escalate privileges while executing the shell.

Therefore, `sudo time /bin/bash` gives the root shell and thus the root flag.

# FunBoxEnum

## Enumeration

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.244.132`

### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -A -Pn -p- -T4 -o nmap.txt 192.168.244.132`

OS Detection &rarr;  `OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`

| **Port** | **Service** | **Other details (if any)**                                   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 22       | SSH         | OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) |
| 80       | HTTP        | Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))                               |

### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.244.132 -f -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index.html
- icons/ (403)
- javascript/ (403)
- mini.php
- robots.txt
- phpmyadmin/

Robots txt file lists `Enum_this_Box` as allowed.

## Exploitation

The webpage `mini.php` is actually a shell interface with some limited options. This was used to read the local flag. This also had the functionality to upload files. This was used to upload the pentest monkey's reverse shell code and get full shell.

## Privilege Escalation

### User

Looked at the `/etc/passwd` file, the users of importance are &rarr; `root`, `goat`, `harry`, `karla`, `lissy`, `sally` and `oracle`. The user `oracle`'s entry is &rarr; `oracle:$1$|O@GOeN\$PGb9VNu29e9s6dMNJKH/R0:1004:1004:,,,:/home/oracle:/bin/bash`. Using John the Ripper to crack this gives the credentials `oracle:hiphop`. This did not work for ssh though.

Running `hydra` to brute-force other users by using &rarr; `hydra -l karla -P /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.225.132`. Ran linenum script for more enumeration, however, nothing useful was discovered. Tried user:user form of credentials for all users, which gave a success for `goat:goat`. This gives the user shell as user `goat`.

### Root

Looking at `sudo -l` to enumerate privilege of the `goat` user, they are allowed to run `/usr/bin/mysql` as root without any password. MySQL has a functionality for spawning a shell. Executing `sudo /usr/bin/mysql` gives the mysql shell and using `\! bash` in the mysql shell spawns a bash shell as the user `root`. This gives the root flag.

# FunBoxRookie

## Enumeration

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.80.107`

### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -A -Pn -p- -T4 -o nmap.txt 192.168.80.107`

OS Detection &rarr;  `OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`

| **Port** | **Service** | **Other details (if any)**                                   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 21       | FTP         | ProFTPD 1.3.5e                                               |
| 22       | SSH         | OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) |
| 80       | HTTP        | Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))                               |

### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.80.107 -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index.html
- robots.txt

Robots txt file contains entry of `/logs/`. However, this is not reachable.

## Exploitation

The ftp actually allows anonymous login despite the nmap service scan not listing it. Looking at the contents, there are a bunch of zip files with different user names. Cracking these files with fcrackzip against the rockyou.txt list of passwords, the following zip files were successfully cracked &rarr;

- cathrine.zip - `catwoman`
- homer.zip - `catwoman`
- tom.zip - `iubire`

Unzipping all these with the respective passwords give an `id_rsa` file for ssh login. All the files are the same, therefore there is only 1 user. Therefore, trying all usernames, the one that works and grants a shell is the user `tom`.

This gives the user flag. Navigation and other actions seem limited, therefore, checked shell and this revealed shell as `/bin/rbash`. This is a restricted shell. Used python to spawn a bash instance to escape this.

## Privilege Escalation

Looking at the user directory, there is a mysql history file. The key entry here is that of &rarr; `insert\040into\040support\040(tom,\040xx11yy22!);`. This indicates additions of the user `tom` into the table `support`.

Checking to see if this is the password for the user `tom` by using `sudo -l`, it indeed works out and shows that `tom` can perform all operations under `sudo` without a password. Therefore, using `sudo su` to get root shell, the root flag can be retrieved.
