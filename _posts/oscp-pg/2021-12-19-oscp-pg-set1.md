The webserver is also running Cute News Management System powered by `CuteNews 2.1.2`.

## Exploitation

Using searchsploit to look at existing vulnerabilities, there are 4 results for the version of CuteNews being run on the system. looking at the RCE expoloit, the python code has easy to understand steps.

Basically, the vulnerability is the ability to upload a reverse shell in place of the avatar for a given user and then navigating to it. The exploit requires various steps. The first is to register a user. This was done at the `/index.php?register` page. This required a captcha value, which did not load inline on the page. Without eefort, the `captcha.php` file found in directory busting gives the captcha code directly. Therefore, a user was registered.

Next, the avatar for the user must be updated. This was done by navigating to `/index.php?mod=main&opt=personal` page. The php reverse shell from pentest monkey is used as the file for upload here. However, this file is rejected. This implies that the server does check for file names or file headers. By hit and trial, the headers are being checked and not the extensions.

Therefore, like the exploit-db version of the RCE, the php code must be prepended with the `GIF8;\n` header to trick the server to think it is an image file. Also, the `Content-Type` header is not checked for file type. The reverse shell uploads successfully and navigating to it at `/uploads/avatar_<username>_php_rev.php` executes the php code and gives the reverse shell. The user flag is also obtained via the `www-data` permissions.

## Privilege Escalation

Enumerating `sudo -l` and setuid files, the interesting option is that of `hping3`. Even if the `sudo -l` says only `--icmp` mode is allowed, since it is a setuid binary, the interface of hping3 can be sirectly exposed. The direct invocation of `hping3` allows for a application shell to execute. This does support usual bash commands.

`whoami` shows the permissions of `root`. Therefore, using the hping3 shell, the root flag can be obtained as well.

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.225.49`

### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.225.49 -f -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt`

Robots txt file has two directories &rarr;

- wordpress-blog/
- files/

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index.html
- robots.txt
- icons/
- files/
- manual/

## Exploitation

The `/icons/` directory has a `.txt` file which seems out of place amongst all the other image files. Upon inspection, it contained an RSA private key. Used this to login to the ssh server running on the machine. For ther user, the most obvious one is `martin` given the clear mentions throughout the website. Upon loggin in, the shell asks for a secret password. Entering something random just drops into the shell and gives the user flag.

The program that asked for the secret password was located at the end of the `.bashrc` in `martin`'s home directory. This was `/var/tmp/login.py`. Upon close inspection, the script has an error to always allow access into the shell. The script is as follows &rarr;

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import os

print("")
print("READY TO ACCESS THE SECRET LAB ? ")
print("")
password = raw_input("secret password : ")

if (password) == "secretsec" or "secretlab" : ## --> Always true
	print("WELCOME ! ")
else:
	print("GET OUT ! ")
	os.system("pkill -u 'martin'")
```

## Privilege Escalation

Looking at the `/etc/passwd` file, the users of interest are `root`, `martin`, `hadi` and `jimmy`.

### User 1

Looking at the crontab, there is a job by `jimmy` that runs every 5 minutes as `python /tmp/sekurity.py`. This file does not exist, therefore, can be created and subsequently executed. This can be used to receive a shell as `jimmy` over netcat. The home directory consists of a `networker` binary, which doesn't seem to do anything concrete.

### User 2

Cracking the password for `hadi` was taking too long, therefore a hack was used to grep out all passwords related to "hadi" from the `rockyou.txt` list. This sublist was also set on the cracking task in parallel, which found the password surprisingly quick, resulting in credentials `hadi:hadi123`.

### Root

As the `hadi` user, running `su root` directly gives the root shell and thus the root flag.

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.124.92`

### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -A -Pn -p- -T4 -o nmap.txt 192.168.124.92`

OS Detection &rarr;  `os_info`

| **Port** | **Service** | **Other details (if any)**                                    |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 22       | SSH         | OpenSSH 5.9p1 Debian 5ubuntu1.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) |
| 80       | HTTP        | Apache httpd 2.2.22 ((Ubuntu))                                |

### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.124.92 -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index/
- index.html
- robots/
- hacker/

The `hacker/` page consists of a base64 string which decodes to `cybersploit{youtube.com/c/cybersploit}`.

## Exploitation

The source of the home page consists of `<!-------------username:itsskv--------------------->`. Therefore, this can be used for a password brute force on the ssh server. This did not reveal a password. Testing the previous base64 string as the password works and grants access to the user `itsskv`.

This gives the first flag.

## Privilege Escalation

Enumerating the setuid binaries gives no info. Looking at the kernel version and os version using `uname -a`, it seems the kernel is indeed an outdated one &rarr; 3.13.0. Using searchsploit to look at exploits for this version using `searchsploit 3.13.0`, there is an overlay.fs exploit for local privilege escalation.

Compiling this binary for the 32 bit version and transferring to the machine via wget, enables getting `root` user shell after running it. This gives the root flag.

### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.225.34 -f -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index.html
- icons/ (403)
- wordpress/
- javascript/ (403)
- phpmyadmin/

Scanning the `/wordpress/` directory again gives the following &rarr;

- index.php (301)
- wp-content/
- wp-login.php
- license.txt
- wp-includes/
- readme.html
- robots.txt
- robots.html
- wp-trackback.php
- wp-admin/ (302)

Running WPScan on the target shows the following result &rarr;

- XMLRPC enabled at `/wordpress/xmlrpc.php`
- Directory listing at `/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/`
- WP-Cron enabled at `/wordpress/wp-cron.php`
- Wordpress version 5.3.2
- Enumerated users &rarr; `yash` and `haclabs`

## Exploitation

Looking at the page `/wordpress/robots.html`, it has a click interface which shows a playful alert. Looking at the code, a new webpage `/wordpress/admindelete.html` was discovered. This page says `LOL,A Noob is looking for a hint`. Based on this, searching for `/wordpress/hint.html` was discovered, which says `Please collect all the API tokens availabe on the home page`. Therefore, the homepage was scoured for API tokens. The following were found &rarr;

```
API old0 : 5F4DCC3B5AA
API old1 : 765D61D8
API old2 : 327DEB
API new : 882CF99
```

When concatenated, this gives `5F4DCC3B5AA765D61D8327DEB882CF99`. This is not any kind of hash, therefore, trying this out in credentials `yash:5F4DCC3B5AA765D61D8327DEB882CF99` works. This gives the shell as user `yash` and the local flag.

## Privilege Escalation

### User

The uuser `yash` is not allowed to run `sudo`, therefore, looked at the setuid binaries. The interesting ones were `/usr/bin/arping` and `/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils`. Looking at the files in the home directory, there is a file `.systemlogs` which contains a bunch of text. This does have the username `haclabs` within `""`. Grepping out `"` to accentuate them shows the following values &rarr;

```
haclabs
A=123456789
+A[::-1]
```

The following values make sense from the above &rarr; `987654321`, `123456789987654321` and `haclabs987654321`. Trying these out for the user `haclabs`, the last one works and grants the shell.

### Root

`haclabs` can execute `sudo` for all commands without a password. Using this to spawn a shell grants the shell as `root` and thus, the root flag.
