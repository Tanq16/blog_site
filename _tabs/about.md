Hey! I am Tanishq, a Security Practician and and a Technology Enthusiast. I work at [Praetorian](https://praetorian.com) as a *Lead Security Engineer*. Hope you're having a fun time exploring my blog. Visit my [website](https://tanishq.page) to get in touch or take a look at my [Resume](https://tanishq.page/assets/resume.pdf).

The blog here is divided into many different categories. On a larger screen (laptop), you can see the menu items of *Categories*, *Tags*, and *Archives* on the left side. Use them to navigate the website. The right hand side will usually contain the table of contents and post tags. For a mobile device, it is simply a continuous page for each post. The buttons on screen will help identify navigation elements.

In general, I talk about homelabs, cybersecurity, computer science, and other fun things on this blog. If you're curious, the banner images in each of the posts are AI-generated artwork. This website is generated using *Jekyll* and the [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page) theme.

Apart from the blogs here, I have worked on a bunch of projects too. You can visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/tanq16) to take a look. If you want to reach out, hit me up using the buttons in the bottom left or through channels mentioned on my [website](https://tanishq.page)! Cheers!
