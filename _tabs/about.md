Hey! I am Tanishq, a Security Practician and and a Technology Enthusiast. I work at [Praetorian](https://praetorian.com) as a Lead Security Engineer. Hope you're having a fun time exploring my blog. Learn more about me on my [website](https://tanishq.page) or through my [Resume](https://tanishq.page/assets/resume.pdf).

The blog here is divided into many different categories. On a larger screen (laptop), you can see options such as Categories, Tags and Archives on the left side. Use them to navigate the blog site. The right hand side will usually contain the table of contents and tags. For a mobile device, it is simply a continuous page for each post. The buttons will help identify the navigation elements.

Also, apart from the blogs here, I have done a bunch of projects as well. You can visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/tanq16) for that. My [website](https://tanishq.page) also lists a bunch of ways to contact me in addition to the buttons in the bottom left, so if you want to reach out, hit me up! Cheers!
